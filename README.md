# Porter-Case-Study-Estimating-Delivery-Times-

🔍 Objective:
The goal was to explore the dataset and identify key factors influencing delivery times, including restaurant type, order size, partner availability, and time of day.

🛠️ Key Actions:

Conducted thorough data cleaning and feature engineering, including handling missing values and outliers.
Explored trends and visualized data using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Analyzed delivery time patterns by store category, partner availability, and time of day.
Built insights on the relationship between order size, timing, and delivery durations.
📈 Insights & Recommendations:

Order Details Matter: Larger orders slightly increase delivery times.
Peak Times Cause Delays: Delivery times spike during afternoons and specific weekdays.
Partner Availability: Increasing on-shift partners during peak hours reduces delays.
Restaurant Type Impacts: Certain cuisines, like Belgian and Brazilian, tend to take longer to deliver.
💡 Outcome:
This project provided actionable insights to optimize delivery operations, improving Porter's ability to estimate delivery times accurately and enhance customer satisfaction.
